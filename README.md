# Directory Size Checker
When I used Windows, I always found the built-in directory size uninformative. I knew that the folder I checked was X GBs big, but where would all that data be? I didn't want to wait around and re-check every single subfolder manually! 

So, this Python script just asks that you input a folder path, it'll go into all subfolders to check their size, and later print them in order, based on their size.

It works on Windows 10/11 and ARM MacOS 14.0, but sometimes on the Mac the exact sizes are slightly off, but I believe it still shows the big picture.
