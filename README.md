# Directory Size Checker
When I used Windows, I always found the built-in directory size uninformative. I knew that the folder I checked was X GBs big, but where would all that data be? I didn't want to wait around and re-check every single subfolder manually! 

So, this Python script just asks that you input a folder path, it'll go into all subfolders to check their size, and later print them in order, based on their size.

I've still yet to try this in MacOS, but it works on Windows 10 & 11. :)
